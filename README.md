# Telecom-Churn-case-Study

In the telecom industry, customers are able to choose from multiple service providers and actively switch from one operator to another. 
telecommunications industry experiences an average of 15-25% annual churn rate. Given the fact that it costs 5-10 times more to acquire a new customer than to retain an existing one, customer retention has now become even more important than customer acquisition.
For many incumbent operators, retaining high profitable customers is the number one business goal. To reduce customer churn, telecom companies need to predict which customers are at high risk of churn.
In this project , will analyze customer-level data of a leading telecom firm, build predictive models to identify customers at high risk of churn and identify the main indicators of churn.

Business Objectives- 

to predict the churn in the last (i.e. the ninth) month using the data (features) from the first three months. To do this task well, understanding the typical customer behavior during churn will be helpful.
This business problem is focused on reducing customer churn in the telecom industry. 
Churn is defined as the act of a customer leaving a particular service provider and switching to a competitor. 
The project will focus on high-value customers, who are defined based on a certain metric and are responsible for 80% of the revenue in the Indian and Southeast Asian markets.
 The goal is to reduce the churn of high-value customers and thereby reduce significant revenue leakage.![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/112237153/220384017-5f62b408-3c7c-498c-8bab-3a92cb0650db.png)


Data Dictionary and Data reading &  Understanding
Data Preparation
Filter high-value customers using the 70th percentile of the average recharge amount in the first two months.
Tag churners based on the usage of calls and mobile internet in the fourth month and remove all the attributes corresponding to the fourth month.
- Build predictive models to predict churn and identify important predictor attributes.
- Handle class imbalance by using techniques such as oversampling or under sampling.
- Visualize the important predictors and recommend strategies to manage customer churn based on the observations.
